## The Prototype pattern
The Prototype is a creational design pattern that allows to create objects based on a template of an existing object through cloning.

### Advantages:
 * It needs less number of classes compared to other creational patterns.
 * Prototype can be customized between creations.

### Disadvantages:
* It may be difficult to implement the process of cloning an object.
* Memory is required to hold the prototype.
* Many prototypes must be passed.

### Uses:
 * when composition, creation, and representation of objects should be decoupled
 * when object creation is time consuming and costly
 * when you want to avoid the creation of a factory hierarchy
 * when classes to be created are specified at run-time 
 * when required objects are similar to existing objects
